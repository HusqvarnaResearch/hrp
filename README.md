# Husqvarna Research Platform

2017 (C) Husqvarna Group

The main repository for Husqvarna Research Platform. This repo contains the basic software and models for you to bring up and run the HRP-enabled mower.
The repository will work with ros (see ros.org) kinetic and indigo releases. Please check documentation for detailed information.

## Usage
In order to use this, you need to have access to an Automower (with HRP-enabled firmware). If you have a nice research project please do not hesitate to contact us to see if you can 
get one as well...we are always interested in nice new research!

NOTE! This is not a GENERAL OFFER and it is not a product you can buy! 
It is not possible to run HRP on commercial available mowers. To get this to work you need to get the mowers from us (loaded with a 
special firmware not publically available). In order to get a mower, please apply to us with the research idea you have (like a one-pager) 
and we will evaluate this against all other applicants. Also note that this offer is directed at research institutes and/or univerisities 
conducting robotics research. For companies, you are free (and most welcome!) to contact us with ideas for possible co-operation 
where this can be utilized as a part of that co-operation, but the mowers are not generally available to companies.

## Cloning
Note that this repo contains "large files" and hence you need to have "git-lfs" installed. Please follow the instructions (for example here: https://git-lfs.github.com/) to install!

## Partners
If you are a HRP partner and want to contribute, please let us know and we will add you to the organization.
